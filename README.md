# Binary Search Tree implementation!
    I created a Binary Search Tree implementation that includes functions such as insert, remove, 
    search, various traversal methods and much more! I also wrote JUnit test cases to test each of 
    these methods, as well as a main method that prompts the user for input on what they want to 
    insert into the tree.
 

## Getting Started
                
### Prerequisites [(Click here!)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial)
    >> Install Java 8 or higher
        
### Installing
##### 1) Clone the directory
    git clone https://github.com/LydiaAlem/BinarySearchTree-Implementation.git
           
         
##### 2) Navigate to the project directory:
    >> cd BinarySearchTree-Implementation
        
##### 3) Compile/run the source code:
    >> javac Main.java
    >> java Main
                
##### 4) Run the JUnit program
    >> On VS Code, this requires additional installation [(Here)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging)
        
        
## Built with

#### * Java - programming language used. 
#### * Maven - dependency management. [(Click here for more info!)](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/)
#### * JUnit - tests the behavior of methods inside the BinaryTree.java class. [(Click here for more info!)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-testing)


        

## Sample Outputs:

  

#### 1) Asking the user for inputs:

## JUNIT test cases includes: 
    
    @Test
    public void insert(){...}
        
    @Test
    public void searchingEmptyTree(){...}
        
    @Test
    public void searchElement(){...}
        
    @Test
    public void removeElement(){...}
        
    @Test 
    public void searchforRemoveElement(){...}
