# BinarySearchTree-implementation
I created a Binary Search Tree implementation that includes functions such as insert, remove, search, various traversal methods and much more! I also wrote JUnit test cases to test each of these methods, as well as a main method that prompts the user for input on what they want to insert into the tree.

1 --> Asks the user for inputs:
    
    Menu:
    1. Insert a node
    2. Remove a node
    3. Search for a node
    4. Traverse the tree
    5. Quit
    
    
    
 
 2 --> JUNIT Tests include:
    
        @Test
        public void insert(){...}
        
        @Test
        public void searchingEmptyTree(){...}
        
        @Test
        public void searchElement(){...}
        
        @Test
        public void removeElement(){...}
        
        @Test 
        public void searchforRemoveElement(){...}
