# BinarySearchTree-implementation
I created a Binary Search Tree implementation that includes functions such as insert, remove, search, various traversal methods and much more! I also wrote JUnit test cases to test each of these methods, as well as a main method that prompts the user for input on what they want to insert into the tree.

    1 --> Asks the user for inputs:
    
    Menu:
    1. Insert a node
    2. Remove a node
    3. Search for a node
    4. Traverse the tree
    5. Quit
