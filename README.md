# BinarySearchTree-implementation
I created a Binary Search Tree implementation that includes functions such as insert, remove, search, various traversal methods and much more! I also wrote JUnit test cases to test each of these methods, as well as a main method that prompts the user for input on what they want to insert into the tree.

int hash = hash2(item); --> int hash = hash1(item);
